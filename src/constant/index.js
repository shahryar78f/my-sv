      'I worked on developing various sections of an e-commerce web application built with Next.js 15 My responsibilities included implementing parts of the admin panel, the client dashboard (user profile, order management, and addresses), product details pages, mega menu, and informational pages such as Contact Us, About Us, and FAQ. In this project, I used React Query, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Zod for data validation. My primary focus was on data management, API integration, form implementation, and improving overall user experience. This project significantly strengthened my skills in React Query, TypeScript, working with forms, tables, modals, UI design, and building clean, reusable components.',
